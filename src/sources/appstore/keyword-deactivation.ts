// Pure predicate for post-scan junk deactivation (see `keyword-gaps.ts`'s
// `scanAndRecord`, which evaluates this after every successful scan, and
// `keyword-store.ts`'s `deactivateJunkKeywords`, which applies it). Flags a
// keyword as "structurally hopeless" — not merely low-scoring today, but
// unlikely to ever be worth re-scanning — so the sweep stops spending budget
// on it. Reversible: deactivation only ever flips `active` to `false`, never
// deletes the row, so re-activating a keyword is a single UPDATE away.
//
// Two independent ways to qualify:
//   1. Lexically junk (`isJunkKeyword`) — same stoplist/short/numeric/
//      non-Latin-script rules the newborn-velocity screener and the
//      dashboard's `hideJunk` filter already use. No scan data needed.
//   2. Data-hopeless: the corpus has scanned it more than once, its latest
//      demand is negligible, no app in the SERP shows any real newcomer
//      traction, and the field's biggest incumbent is still small — i.e.
//      scanning it again is very unlikely to surface anything.
//
// NEVER applies to `source: 'manual' | 'seed'` — a human explicitly asked
// for these to stay in the corpus. That exclusion is enforced HERE (defense
// in depth, so this predicate alone is never wrong) AND, independently, in
// `deactivateJunkKeywords`'s SQL WHERE clause (belt + suspenders — a caller
// bug here can never touch a manual/seed row).
